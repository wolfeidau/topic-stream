# topic-stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wolfeidau/topic-stream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wolfeidau/topic-stream)

The topic-stream is a simple stream which enables writing messages over AMQP to a topic. It is designed to be used with other steams to enable compression, encoding or encryption of data which is finally sent to a topic.

# TODO

* Add support for MQTT.
* Add the option to just pass an AMQP URL.
